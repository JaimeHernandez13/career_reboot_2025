# EDA - World Happiness Report

In this project, I explore the **World Happiness Report** dataset to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Objective

To gain insights from the data, understand relationships between features (like GDP, freedom, corruption perception, etc.), and visualize how happiness scores vary across countries and regions.
