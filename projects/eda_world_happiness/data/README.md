# data/

This folder contains the raw dataset files used for the analysis.

- `world-happiness-report.csv`: Original dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
- Files in this folder are unmodified and kept in their original form for reproducibility.

Please do not edit files directly here â€” cleaned versions should be saved in the `outputs/` folder or handled within notebooks.
